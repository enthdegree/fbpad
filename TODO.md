  - User interface improvements
    - Replace the logo, right now it is an old gnome-terminal logo desaturated.
    - On exit it leaves the screen a mess (black)
    - Add scripts to easily control brightness
    - Add a mechanism to easily change orientation and regenerate fonts
    - Add a statusbar (battery, etc). Can be done by limiting fbpad to only touch part of the framebuffer (you can do this with an environment variable, I think)
    - Attempt to rescue the session if the keyboard dies:
      - If the keyboard event device goes away, someone should try to find another keyboard or present an onscreen kb to use
      - The onscreen keyboard from inkvt would fit into kbreader perfectly
  - fbpad.sh
    - Actually try to find a keyboard in /dev/input/event##. Currently we dumbly, nonportably pick /dev/input/event3 which "sometimes works on a Clara BW"
    - Generally just do things right, currently this script is nothing more than a mangled version of the current koreader.sh
  - fbpad
    - Assess whether it would be better to refresh regions intelligently instead of fullscreen every time, implement if so
    - Restore fbpad hotkey functionality. This could be done using named pipes:
      - Each mainloop fbpad could do a nonblocking read of a char b from pipe /tmp/kbreader_$uid
      - If a byte is read the next ttyinput will handle b as if it were a syskey
      - '\0' means do nothing
      - In kbreader:
        - Add a special escape hotkey: if, say, C-` is pressed, then write the next char to /tmp/kbreader_$uid instead of stdout
        - If C-` is pressed again kbreader would write '\0' to /tmp/kbreader_$uid and write C-` to stdout
  - kbreader
    - An annoyance: after fbpad exits, we need to type a char for our `kbreader | fbpad` chain to terminate (by SIGPIPE)
    - There is no end to how much better the keyboard interpreter could be. Different locales? Compose key? Numpad? Unicode? 
    - An onscreen keyboard fallback would be good. inkvt already did the hard work of drawing it and interpreting taps.
